						<h2>What is the Boston Running Project?</h2>
						<p>Long ago, on a continent not so far away, there were once tribes of humans that would run. Run across the plains of Africa. Run so far and so fast as to outrun their prey. Over the tens of millennia since those days mankind has continued to run. Not just for survival but also for sport and for personal improvement. These days, we in the city of Boston, eek out time from our busy lives to run. The difficult part is where to run. Do we run on the sidewalks, along the river, or through trails in the parks? Questions dealing with where, when, and why rack our minds when deciding on a new route. This is what we hope to solve. We endeavor to ease this process and to ascertain why people in Boston run where they run.
						</p>
						<p> (OLD) We set out to show how Boston runners choose where to run.
							By analyzing thousands of running routes and comparing their densities
							to the density of trees and pedestrians throughout the city, we hoped to find 
							a correlation which would indicate that runners choose their routes based on their surroundings. </p>

							<p>Here is a basic heatmap of the running routes in boston. This heatmap was generated using R which in turn used data collected using Python from the MapMyRun API. The current iteration of this heatmap uses 1600 different routes to show the areas that people run in. <br> As you can see there is quite a few routes that go through the center of the city </p>
